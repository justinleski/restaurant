### Purpose
 The purpose of this project is to dabble with **webpack**. Moreover, how webpack allows for modules to be accessed and updated in a new way. This method allows for much better organization than IIFEs.

### Challenges Faced
#### Webpack
- Learning webpack was a difficult curve, particularly all of the set up required. I managed to miss setting a template for the `HtmlWebpackPlugin` meaning the output in `/dist` did not reflect my `index.html` file in `/src`.

#### Modularity
- Organizing files into modules using `import` and `export` in tandem with webpack is not an entirely new experience, but reminds me to keep in mind the functionality of each file and its purpose so it can be built in such a way.
- Specifically, working with the DOM alongside modules and seeing the visual feedback on what happens when the content for a div is changed provides new insight on how these files interact.
